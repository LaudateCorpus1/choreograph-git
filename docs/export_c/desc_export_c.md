# Export in C language

Great, I created my movements, my goal is now to be able to insert them into my code.

## Description of my Robot

In your code, in order to initialize your robot, you can translate the skeleton description file:

- Open your project or directly the squelette.json file

- Select the desired export format in the tool window

- Then in the *Skeleton -> Export to ...* menu

<div align="center"><img alt="skeleton.json" width="49%" src="../skeleton/img_skeleton_json.png" />&nbsp;<img alt="export_c.screen" width="49%" src="./img_export_c.png" /></div>
